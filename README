This file is provided for a quick reference to some of the functionality and
future functionality of this 3D engine.

Keyboard Commands
=================

   ESC - exit the demo
   CURSOR UP - move forwards
   CURSOR DOWN - move backwards
   CURSOR LEFT - turn counter-clockwise
   CURSOR RIGHT - turn clockwise
   INSERT - increase size of screen
   DELETE - decrease size of screen
   PGUP - move up y-axis
   PGDN - move down y-axis

Right now, the engine supports a bi-quadrilateral projection scheme (ala 
Wolfenstien) but with some noteable exceptions:

  First, the engine supports lighting in the form of distance shading
  (i.e. it get darker the farther away one goes in the z direction) for 
  an added effect of depth.  In the future, we will add localize lighting
  so that certain rooms can be darker than others and a torch can light up
  the surrounding areas (ala Doom).

  Second, we have the ability to move along the y-axis and can create the
  effect of bobbing up and down as we walk, jumping, falling down, etc.

  Third, our floors and ceilings are texture-mapped adding even more to the
  visual detail.  We will probably put in some detail options including 
  shutting off floor and ceiling texturing to support slower machines.  We
  can even shut off the ceiling and provide and scrolling skyline.

  Fourth, the engine suppors 8 rotation views for any object or sprite
  (ala Doom).

  Lastly, (not shown in demo) our ceiling and floor tile suppor morphing for
  realistic contours.  In simpler terms, we can make some ceilings higher 
  than others and the adjacent tiles will stretch and morph to make a smooth
  transitional surface.  We can thus create cavernous rooms with huge 
  monsters.
